We achieve this without damaging the environment or by lopsiding the tokenomics to benefit only the few. Before we discuss how Dijets compares to other blockchains, let's try to get to the heart of the problem all blockchains are trying to solve.\n\n## What is Trust Minimisation?\n\nTrust minimisation is a valuable security property that only blockchain technology is uniquely positioned to generate. It replaces handshakes, brand reputation, and paper contracts with apathetic, logic based guarantees based on computer code, cryptography, and decentralised consensus. These superior guarantees provided by blockchains form the basis of cryptographic truth. With the newfound vigour of ushering in a technological revolution, blockchains, projects and development teams all rushed to churn out a solution after another. An enhancement to every possible legacy industry with blockchains added superior security of cryptographic truths. And although Blockchains have succeeded in bringing trust minimisation to new use cases such as bitcoin and digital asset trading etc. They have historically struggled to maintain trust minimisation for use cases that require speeds and costs comparable to traditional computing systems. These scalability limitations can be felt by users in the form of high transaction costs and cause developers to doubt whether blockchains can support high-value use cases that hinge on handling data in real time.\n\n## Achieving scalability through hardware\n\n<b>Solana</b> is a general purpose blockchain claiming to achieve tens of thousands of transactions per second. To sustain such elevated levels of on-chain activity, the network has to reply on users operating extremely advanced computers to operate nodes and validators. The requirements to operate a node on Solana are significantly more costly than almost all other public blockchains and therefore, usually operated exclusively by a business or institution that cab afford it, rather than an individual. By increasin barriers to entry the network seems to be heading towards the very reason blockchains exist - Centralisation. The power to influence the network or to have single points of failure in the system.\n\nThey recommend validators run hardware with <em>24</em> Cores, 128 GB Memory, 4 TB NVMe disks, Nvidia 2080 ti graphics cards (4000 cores) and very high bandwidth connections. Also worth noting is that even with advanced machinery supporting the network, the Solana blockchain is frequently experiencing outages during times of high transaction activity.\n\n\n## Communication Rounds\n\nAn example of a classical consensus protocol typically includes an all-to-all voting and has a designated leader who initiates the decision process and a series of all-to-all communication rounds to ensure that all correct/reputedly-good nodes reach the same decision. Such a protocol typically requires quadratic communication overhead with all-to-all communication of O(n²). This means for each round if there is:\n\n1. **10 Nodes:** A network of 10 nodes, then it equates to 100 messages\n2. **1000 Nodes:** A network of 1,000 nodes, equates to 1,000,000 messages\n3. **100,000 Nodes:** A network of 100,000 nodes equates to 10,000,000,000 messages\n\nThis spells two massive issues for most protocols to cope with. \n\n- Deal with massive communication overheads; and \n- Maintain low latency and high throughput with increasing number of nodes. \n\nGiven the full context, this is infact a catch-22 situation for the protocol so an easy way that many blockchains cut down on the overheads and achieve better performance is simply by sacrificing decentralisation.
