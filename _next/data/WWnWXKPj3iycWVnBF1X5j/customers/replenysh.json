After reading the [Supabase Auth documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/overview) the team determined they can have the functionality they need, like SMS OTP. When they saw [Mobbin are using Supabase at scale](https://supabase.com/case-studies-mobbin), they decided to migrate to Supabase.\n\n## Globally recognized brands need quality at scale\n\nLess than a day after beginning development with Supabase, the team completed their SMS OTP implementation, and deployed their app to the app store a few weeks later.\n\n![Replenysh-Mobile-App](/images/blog/replenysh/Replenysh-Mobile-App.png)\n\nReplenysh clients include brands with global recognition and millions of customers. With their reputation at stake, major brands have a high-quality threshold. If a global brand asks its customers to adopt a technology, the user experience must be high quality and reliable. Their customers' primary interaction point is mobile-first. This means a robust and smooth mobile Auth experience is non-negotiable. After switching to Supabase, when they demo, clients are instantly impressed with just how easy it is for users to log in with an SMS OTP and start participating in the circular economy. As a result, some of the world's largest retailers and beverage companies have recently joined Replenysh and the circular economy.\n\n![Replenysh-large-screen-view](/images/blog/replenysh/Replenysh-large-screen-view.png)\n\n## Supabase means faster development and reduced maintenance\n\n<Quote img=\"clark-dinnison.jpeg\" caption=\"Clark Dinnison, Head of Product at Replenysh.\">\n  <p>\n    We saw the Auth update for launch week we thought it was the perfect time to get going with\n    Supabase.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    We implemented & pushed live phone (OTP) auth and had something ready to deploy to the app store\n    in less than 24-hours!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Supabase's developer experience lived up to its reputation.

They are ready to help major brands engage with their users through participation in the circular economy. With Supabase, the team knows they have a slick auth experience, reduced DevOps overhead, and can continue to scale with Postgres.
