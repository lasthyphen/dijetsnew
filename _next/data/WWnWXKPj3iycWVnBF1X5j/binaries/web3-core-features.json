Web 1.0 (1994-2004)\n\nWeb 1.0 was the first iteration of the Internet we’re familiar with today, emerging in 1994 and ending around 2004 with the rise of social media giants like Twitter and Facebook. While the general public came to learn about the Web 1.0 Internet around 1994, Web 1.0 actually started as a U.S. government program called ARPANET, or Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, in 1968.

Lets briefly look at the two critical components\n\n### Blockchains\n\nA blockchain is a highly secure and decentralised network that allows people to store data, exchange value, and record transaction activity in a shared ledger that is not controlled by any central authority. Blockchain networks serve as the backbone of Web3, providing secure execution environments that allow for the creation, distribution, and trading of cryptocurrencies, as well as the development of programmable smart contracts. Blockchains are the settlement layer of Web3.\n\n### Cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital coins/tokens that leverage the decentralised and tamper-proof environments of blockchain networks to facilitate highly secure transactions. They are the native currencies of Blockchains hosting the Web3 decentralised applications (dApps) and can also be used to pay for Web3 services and participate in Web3 governance & economy.\n\nBefore the advent of blockchain technology, tokens were essentially units of value that could be purchased and exchanged to pay for specific products and/or services, such as tokens for highway tolls or amusement park rides and games.
