After 2 weeks of research, he settled on an idea - build a “second brain” where a user could dump all their digital knowledge (audio, URLs, text, and code) into a vector store and query it with GPT4.\n\nHe built the first version in a single afternoon, pushed it to GitHub, and then [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/_StanGirard/status/1657021618571313155?s=20). One viral tweet later, and [Quivr](https://github.com/StanGirard/quivr) was born.\n\n## Choosing a vector database\n\nA critical piece of the tech stack was the vector store.

The hosted database provides embedding storage for 1.6 million vectors and similarity search for over 100,000 files.\n\nWith 500 daily active users, the [Quivr.app](http://Quivr.app) is becoming the preferred way for users to create a second brain.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- Backend: Fast API + Langchain, hosted on AWS Fargate\n- Frontend: Next.js, hosted on Vercel\n- Database: Supabase Vector, using pgvector\n- LLM: OpenAI, Anthropic, Nomic\n- Semantic search using GPT For ALL, Anthropic, and OpenAI\n- Auth: Supabase Auth\n","name":"Quivr","title":"Brings the benefits of tokenisation by enabling users to convert real world assets into digital assets.","meta_title":"Brings the benefits of tokenisation by enabling users to convert real world assets into digital assets.","description":"Learn how one of the most popular Generative AI projects uses Supabase as their Vector Store.","meta_description":"Learn how one of the most popular Generative AI projects uses Supabase as their Vector Store.","author":"rory_wilding","author_title":"Supabase","author_url":"https://github.com/kiwicopple","author_image_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10214025?s=400&u=c6775be2ae667e2acae3ccd347fed62bb3f5b3e7&v=4","authorURL":"https://github.com/kiwicopple","logo":"/images/customers/logos/light/dijetex.png","logo_inverse":"/images/customers/logos/light/dijetex.png","og_image":"/images/customers/og/quivr.jpg","tags":["supabase"],"date":"2023-10-05","company_url":"https://quivr.app","stats":[],"misc":[{"label":"Use case","text":"Generative AI"},{"label":"Solutions","text":"Supabase Vector, Supabase Auth"}],"about":"Quivr is an open source 'second brain'.
