Team members who were not database experts found it easy to navigate and make changes, reducing reliance on specialized expertise and improving their overall workflow.\n4. **Simplicity:** Supabase provides the ability to add new columns in a no-code manner, which provided flexibility and agility in responding to evolving requirements. This feature empowered the team to make on-the-fly adjustments and meet their immediate needs effectively.\n5. **Flexibility:** Berri AI also appreciated Supabase's flexibility in allowing them to choose their [preferred embedding method](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/quickstarts/generate-text-embeddings), as it was not tied to a specific embedding model. This ensured compatibility and adaptability for their specific use case.\n\nThe migration to [Supabase Vector](https://supabase.com/vector), which facilitated efficient storage and retrieval of vectors, proved to be a significant advantage for Berri AI's operations.\n\n<Quote img=\"krrish-d.png\" caption=\"Krrish D. - Co-Founder & CEO, Berri AI\">\n  Switching to Supabase Vector was a game-changer for us. The faster view times allowed me to\n  quickly access and debug data, enhancing my ability to analyze individual customer issues. The\n  no-code option to add new columns on the fly was fantastic, enabling us to adapt swiftly.\n</Quote>\n\n## What They Built\n\nBerri AI built a platform that enables developers to create and manage custom ChatGPT instances for each individual user, integrating seamlessly with their unique data.\n\n![BerriAI is backed by YCombinator](/images/customers/berriai/berriai-image.jpeg)\n\nWith Berri AI, businesses can rapidly scale the power of ChatGPT to cater to the needs of every user. The platform provides an out-of-the-box solution for managing a fleet of ChatGPT instances, offering businesses the ability to deliver personalized responses to user queries. This includes answering specific questions related to order status, monthly revenue, or generating personalized learning experiences in the education technology (EdTech) sector, such as summarizing lecture slides or generating practice questions from textbooks.\n\nThe platform's integration with Supabase empowers businesses to unlock the full potential of ChatGPT and deliver customized solutions for a wide range of use cases.\n\n<Quote img=\"ishaan-jaffer.png\" caption=\"Ishaan Jaffer - Co-Founder & CTO, Berri AI\">\n  With Supabase, my life has become much easier. Previously, managing connection pools and dealing\n  with errors in the Postgres database hosted on AWS was a constant challenge. I had to write 40-50\n  lines of code for each function, handle rollbacks, and struggle with dependencies and errors. But\n  with Supabase, updating the database is now just one line of code. I no longer need to deal with\n  complex dependencies and obscure errors. Additionally, the frustration of using pgadmin is gone.\n  Supabase provides a simple UI that allows me to effortlessly manage and interact with my tables.\n</Quote>\n\n## The Results\n\nBerri AI achieved significant improvements in their operations by choosing Supabase Vector. They experienced streamlined database management, increased update velocity, and improved efficiency in accessing and debugging data. The user-friendly interface and flexibility of Supabase empowered non-experts within the team and facilitated agile adaptations to changing requirements. Overall, this decision transformed their workflow, enhancing productivity and positioning Berri AI for continued success and growth.\n\nTo learn more about how Supabas Vector can help you store vector embeddings at scale and build AI apps with ease, [reach out to us](https://forms.supabase.com/enterprise).\n\n## Tech stack\n\n- Zeet\n- AWS\n- OpenAI\n- Hugging Face\n- Supabase\n","name":"Berri AI","title":"Secure, instant & decentralised messenger that enables digital asset transfers.","meta_title":"Qowalts is an instant messaging platform","description":"Learn how Berri AI overcame challenges with self-hosting their vector database on AWS RDS and successfully migrated to Supabase.","meta_description":"Learn how Berri AI overcame challenges with self-hosting their vector database on AWS RDS and successfully migrated to Supabase.","author":"paul_copplestone","author_title":"Supabase","author_url":"https://github.com/Dijets-Inc","author_image_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10214025?s=400&u=c6775be2ae667e2acae3ccd347fed62bb3f5b3e7&v=4","authorURL":"https://github.com/Dijets-Inc","logo":"/images/customers/logos/berriai.png","logo_inverse":"/images/customers/logos/light/berriai.png","og_image":"/images/customers/og/berriai.jpg","tags":["supabase"],"date":"2023-06-06","company_url":"https://dijets.io","stats":[{"stat":"00,000","label":"Example stat"},{"stat":"00,000","label":"Example stat"},{"stat":"00,000","label":"Example stat"}],"misc":[{"label":"Backed by","text":"Y Combinator"}],"about":"Supercharge your products with the power of LLMs like ChatGPT & go from prototype to production in less than a week.","toc":{"json":[{"content":"The Challenge","slug":"the-challenge","lvl":2,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"Why they chose Supabase:","slug":"why-they-chose-supabase","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"What They Built","slug":"what-they-built","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"The Results","slug":"the-results","lvl":2,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Tech stack","slug":"tech-stack","lvl":2,"i":4,"seen":0}],"highest":2,"tokens":[{"type":"paragraph_open","tight":false,"lines":[1,2],"level":0},{"type":"inline","content":"Berri AI is an API for businesses to programmatically create custom ChatGPT instances on their data.
