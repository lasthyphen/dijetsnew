It is also a way for consumers to cut insurance companies out of the industry altogether, forming contract-bound communities that add funds to a pool and extract money when the group approves a claim.\n\nConsumers in todays digital world demand greater convenience and product customisation with an even greater transparency with emphasis on demonstrating data handling practises.
