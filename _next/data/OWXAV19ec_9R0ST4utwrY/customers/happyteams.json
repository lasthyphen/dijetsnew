But one year in, they were experiencing scaling issues. They needed to handle thousands of users while also shipping new features and building out integrations. Issues with database slowness and concurrent connections were holding them back.\n\nMichael Dever, founder and CTO of HappyTeams, realized it was time for a change.

The team was experiencing uneven performance with Heroku, which was sluggish at times. Supabase was consistently fast.\n\n2.  **Enabling a large number of direct connections and connection pooling with PgBouncer**. HappyTeams was constantly hitting limits on the number of database connections. They could solve this problem with Supabase's [flexible plans](https://supabase.com/pricing) and [support for PgBouncer](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-pgbouncer).\n\n3.  **Quality of support, documentation, and onboarding**: While Heroku provided no support at the tier they were on, the Supabase team was readily available: \"Responses were powerful and they answered all my questions, even on a Sunday. That just further sold the product for me.\" He was also impressed with the [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs) on the Supabase website and the onboarding process.\n\n4.  **Lower costs**. Moving to Supabase reduced HappyTeams's costs: The base plan comes with everything they need to scale the product.\n\n<Quote img=\"michael-dever-happyteams.jpeg\" caption=\"Michael Dever - CTO of HappyTeams\">\n  Great documentation, great product, great pricing. It sells itself, really.\n</Quote>\n\n## Supabase provides a fast and reliable production database\n\nAfter a 30-minute migration, HappyTeams can iterate quickly, add new features, and improve their product based on customer feedback\n\nOnce they made the decision, migrating from Heroku to Supabase was simple. HappyTeams completed their database migration in less than an hour using pg_dump and pg_restore.\n\nPerformance is no longer an issue. \"Supabase just worked\", says Michael. Pooling connections using PgBouncer was effortless - solving a recurring pain point for HappyTeams.\n\n\"Supabase is so fast.
